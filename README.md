# COVID-19-s-Impact-on-Retail-Sales
The dataset used in this work brings together several sources that capture the economic and
behavioral impacts of COVID-19 on retail trade sales within the United States. Key components
involved data from the U.S. Census Bureau covering retail trade sales, including total sales and
e-commerce-specific sales, which were based on a survey of retail establishments. We used Pandas, which cleaned and merged our data in such a
manner that the datasets were all well-structured and compatible for analysis. We went ahead to
use Matplotlib, combined with NumPy, to create visualizations for our data that would greatly
help portray trends and relationships. In addition, we fitted and trained a polynomial regression
model using sklearn.linear_model, trying to find a way to make good predictions of outcomes
from established patterns. We also did Pearson's correlation to compute the coefficients for the
strength and direction of relationships between key variables. Our hypothesis was that essential products retail sectors experienced a small decrease in sales during the pandemic
compared to non-essential sectors. E-commerce retail sectors remained resilient during the
pandemic, experiencing minimal impact, while traditional retail trade sectors faced significant
declines in sales. Our analysis underlines the critical role e-commerce has played in
maintaining economic activity during disruptions and shows the adaptability of consumer
behavior in response to unprecedented challenges.
